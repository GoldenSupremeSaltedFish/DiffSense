    action: "added"
    file: "**"
    impact: runtime
    severity: high
    rationale: "Collection modification (remove) detected inside a loop. This often leads to ConcurrentModificationException or undefined behavior."

  - id: security.behavior_change_auth

    impact: security
    severity: high
    rationale: "Changes in security modules detected. Requires careful security review."

  - id: runtime.validation_removed
    # This overlaps with input_normalization_removed, but we can add a specific one if needed.
    # The user asked for it as a separate category, but we covered it with the signal above.
    # Let's add a placeholder or duplicate if distinct signal is available.
    # For now, relying on input_normalization_removed covers 'validate/check' calls.
    # But let's add a rule that watches for 'validation' in filename or package.
    file: "**/validation/**"
    match: ".*" # Match any change
    impact: runtime
    severity: high
    rationale: "Changes in validation logic modules."
